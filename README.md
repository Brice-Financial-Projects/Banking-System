# 🏦 Python Banking System for Fintech Applications

A modular, object-oriented Python backend system simulating real-world banking workflows. This project demonstrates the foundational components of a fintech-style architecture, including customer account creation, transaction handling, loan management, and activity logging — all using clean code principles and scalable design patterns.

Designed for Python backend engineering roles in the fintech space, this system emphasizes:

- Domain-driven modeling (`BankAccount`, `Customer`, `Loan`, `AccountActivity`)
- Layered architecture (`model/`, `service/`, `db/`)
- Exception handling with custom errors (e.g., `OverdraftError`)
- Readiness for integration into a REST API (Flask/FastAPI/Django-compatible)
- Environment-specific configuration support via `.env` and `settings.py` scaffolding

All functionality was developed **manually, without AI code generation**, to deepen language fluency and build production-ready coding habits.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Create and close user accounts
- ✅ Deposit and withdraw with balance validation
- ✅ Track loan objects and activity logs
- ✅ Raise custom exceptions for overdraft protection
- ✅ In-memory database (`accounts_db`) simulating future PostgreSQL implementation
- ✅ Clean OOP class separation for long-term extensibility
- ✅ `.env`-driven configuration setup to support development, testing, and production modes

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project reinforces key backend development skills relevant to fintech roles:

- Structuring scalable, testable Python systems
- Building full backend logic without frameworks or boilerplate
- Demonstrating code ownership without reliance on AI tools
- Laying the groundwork for full-stack or API-driven fintech apps

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Standard library only
- `python -m venv` for isolated environments
- Git/GitHub for version control and documentation
- `.env` file (with `config/settings.py`) for environment variable-based app configuration

## 🧭 Future Enhancements

- ✅ Unit testing with `pytest`
- 🔜 PostgreSQL integration to replace in-memory store
- 🔜 REST API via Flask, FastAPI, or Django
- 🔜 Authentication system with role-based permissions
- 🔜 Config class expansion to support dynamic toggling (Dev, Test, Prod)

## 🧠 About This Project

This project is part of my transition from civil engineering to software engineering, with a focus on backend development for fintech applications.

It reflects my commitment to writing clean, extensible code — and building systems that mirror real-world financial infrastructure from the ground up.

> All code was written manually. AI was used solely for critique and review purposes.
